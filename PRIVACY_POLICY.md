# Privacy Policy

Last updated: May 16, 2025

This Privacy Policy applies to the Geminiâ„¢ Side Panel Chrome Extension (hereinafter, "Extension").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information.

**Information Collection and Use**

The Extension is designed to respect your privacy. We want to be crystal clear: **the Extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information or any other user data whatsoever.**

All functionalities of the Extension are performed locally on your computer, within your browser. No data about your Browse activity, your interactions with the Extension, or any other personal information is sent to our servers or any third-party servers.

**Data Usage**

Since no information is collected, no information is used by the Extension for any purpose other than its immediate, local functionality as described in the Extension's purpose. We do not track your usage of the Extension.

**Third-Party Services**

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites or services that you may access through the Extension (e.g., if the Extension provides a link or embeds content from another site). We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you interact with. The Extension itself does not transmit any of your data to such third-party services.

**Permissions**

Any permissions requested by the Extension during installation are solely for the purpose of enabling its core functionality within your browser. These permissions are not used to collect or transmit your data. Please refer to the Extension's description for details on why specific permissions are required.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page or within the Extension's information section in the Chrome Web Store.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
